1. Don’t spend too much time on the prep work.
2. Don’t spend too little time on the prep work.

If you spend too much time studying, you’ll never get to solve Leetcode/CTCI problems. Conversely, you’ll be lost if you spend too little time on the prep work. It is important that you spend the right amount of time for the prep work to make sure that you do not waste your time.

## Data Structures
- Dynamic Array
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
- Graphs
- Trie

## Algorithms
<li> Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
Stability in Sorting
Mergesort
Quicksort
Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
Binary Search
Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
Permutations
Subsets
BFS Graph
DFS Graph
Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
Topological Sort
Detect cycle in an undirected graph
Detect a cycle in a directed graph
Count connected components in a graph
Find strongly connected components in a graph
  
## Prep work
Once you are comfortable with the data structures & algorithms above, do the following exercise multiple times (at least 2–3 times) until you can do them with your eyes closed.

Implement an ArrayList from scratch
Reverse a linked list
Implement a Stack & a Queue using Array
Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.
Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
Write the merge sort algorithm
Write the quicksort algorithm
Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms. Here’s an interesting website.
Implement a trie.
Learn these important bit manipulation tricks.
